# **BATCH:** A Group Friend Finder Android Application

## **Overview**
 
 Batch is an Android mobile application designed to help groups of people meet and connect with other groups. Modern matchmaking
 
 applications,such as Tinder, Bumble, or Hinge, focus primarily on connecting people romantically, limiting interactions to just two
 
 individuals. While some of these applications do allow you to meet others for the purpose of friendships, it can be nerve-racking for some
 
 to meet others on a one-to-one basis. Oftentimes, it feels much more comfortable meeting others when your own friends are present, as they
 
 offer social familiarity and a fall-back if you do not hit it off with the strangers you meet. Our application will help expand this idea to provide a
 
 way for individuals to meet in a group setting, with the     goal for groups to meet platonically through common interests.
